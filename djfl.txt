<p class="description">Hello I am earth. Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only<br>
         astronomical object known to harbor life. According to radiometric <br>dating estimation and other evidence,
         earth formed over 4.5 billion<br> years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space,<br>
         especially the Sun and the Moon, which is Earth's only natural satellite.<br> Earth orbits around
         the Sun in 365.256 solar days, a period known as<br> an Earth sidereal year. During this time, 
         Earth rotates about its axis<br>366.256 times, that is, a sidereal year has 366.256 sidereal
         days.  Earth's<br> axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing<br> seasons
         on Earth. The gravitational interaction between Earth and<br> the Moon causes tides, stabilizes
         Earth's orientation on its axis, and <br>gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the densest planet
          in the Solar<br> System and the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets. <br>To know more about me click on the picture.
